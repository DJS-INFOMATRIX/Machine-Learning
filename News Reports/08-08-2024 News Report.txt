- Researchers at the IIT Roorkee  have developed an AI system that can interpret Indian Sign Language (ISL) system in real-time, empowering millions of deaf individuals across India
- Real-time ISL recognition can facilitate seamless communication between sign language users and non-signers, breaking down language barriers.
- The AI system uses a combination of:
    1. Deep Learning for Gesture Recognition
    2. NLP Translates recognized gestures into spoken language.
    3. Computer Vision: Tracks and analyzes sign language gestures through video input.
- The researchers aim to refine the system and expand its capabilities to accommodate regional sign language variations, paving the way for a more inclusive and connected India

(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4289198) 

- Researchers at Indian Institute of Science have developed an innovative system called, "Crop Doctor," to diagnose and predict crop diseases
- Crop Doctor uses advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze images of crops, identify diseases, and provide personalized recommendations for treatment
- The System Works as follows:
    1. Image Analysis: Farmers upload images of their crops to the Crop Doctor platform.
    2. Deep Learning-based Diagnosis: AI algorithms analyze the images to identify diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies.
    3. Personalized Recommendations: The system provides tailored advice on treatment, pesticide application, and fertilizer usage.
- A pilot project in Maharashtra's agricultural belt has already shown its results, with a 25% increase in yields and a 30% reduction in chemical usage.

- Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have developed "MindPal," a deep learning-based system that can detect depression with unprecedented accuracy
- MindPal uses advanced neural networks to analyze:
    1. **Speech Patterns**: Identifies subtle changes in tone, pitch, and behavior.
    2. **Facial Expressions**: Recognizes micro-expressions, revealing hidden emotions.
    3. **Brain Activity**: Analyzes EEG signals to detect abnormal patterns.
- MindPal has an astonishing 95% accuracy rate in detecting depression, outperforming existing diagnostic methods
- The IISc researchers are partnering with hospitals and mental health organizations to integrate MindPal into clinical settings
